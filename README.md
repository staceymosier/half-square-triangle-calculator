Half Square Triangle Calculator for Quilting Projects

There are many short cuts when making a quilt. We certainly do not cut out individual pieces of fabric, one by one and expect them to be uniform in shape.

A popular method of making half-square-triangles is to lay 2 squares, right-side fabric facing each other, and stitch 2 lines diagonally 1/4" inch from the center hypotenuse.

For example, this chevron pattern is created using only half square triangles:

This simple static project, with some light JavaScript, will provide a calculator to determine what size squares to begin with, so that you can achieve the desired number of columns and rows for your quilt size.

Happy Quilting!
